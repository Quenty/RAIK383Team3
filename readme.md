# Client problem statement
A transportation company is seeking to improve its operations. Their current practices are outdated as they are not integrated, and rely on manual operation, which is error prone and costly. The company uses contractors that are truck drivers and can haul loads as needed across the nation. When a shipment order comes in, currently by email, a human dispatcher reviews it, and cross-references it with an Excel spreadsheet where they maintain the list of available contractors and their profiles, together with their status: whether idle or on assignment, at their home base, or at a destination where they had finished an assignment. The dispatcher tries to find the best matching contractor that can haul the given shipment, and assign them the request and send them the work order. The company wants you to automate this process for them, integrated into a web application. Their ultimate objective is ensuring optimal assignments of shipments to contractors to keep costs low.
