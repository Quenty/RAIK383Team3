# Release candidates
Release candidates emerge in develop when a good, stable set of features have been merged in, and their integration tested. Each release candidate will be pushed to the master branch where I can review it (at the two checkpoints during implementation later in the term). That way, while I review your master versions, you can continue working on your develop versions. 

# Requirements folder
In the team repo folder structure, at the same level as the project README, make a folder called 'Requirements' where you will write up your requirements for this assignment. Each requirement should be a scenario with the structure discussed in class (and in the book, Figure 4.10 in the 10th Edition, the iLearn Uploading Photos scenario; note that the iLearn system example is not in the 9th Edition of the book). Each scenario should be in a separate file under Requirements/. Please name each file suggestively in regards to the code feature it describes (for the given example that would be uploadingPhotos).

# Scenarios
A structured form of user story
- Scenarios should include
    - A description of the starting situation;
    - A description of the normal flow of events;
    - A description of what can go wrong;
    - Information about other concurrent activities;
    - A description of the state when the scenario finishes.
